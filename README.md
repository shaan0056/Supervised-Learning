# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repo contains Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms applied on two different datasets from UCI repository and the analysis in documented form.


How to execute the code:

In order to execute the code, use the below command in the terminal

<code>python <script name.py></code>

The following are the names of the scripts for the five learners

* Decision Tree - decisionTree.py
* K Nearest Neighbors - kNN.py
* Support Vector Machines - supportVectorMachine.py
* Boosting - boosting.py
* Neural Networks - neuralNetwork.py

Once the code is executed, the plots will be saved in the directory and the stats will be displayed in the terminal.
